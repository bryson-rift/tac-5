# Feature: Test Webhook Function

## Feature Description
Create a simple test file to validate webhook functionality is working correctly. This feature creates a temporary file `test-webhook.md` in the project root containing simple mock webhook data for testing purposes.

## User Story
As a developer
I want to create a test webhook file with mock data
So that I can verify webhook integration is functioning properly

## Problem Statement
We need a simple way to test and validate that the webhook system is receiving and processing data correctly. Currently there is no test file to quickly validate webhook functionality without triggering actual GitHub events.

## Solution Statement
Create a test file `test-webhook.md` in the project root containing mock webhook payload data. This file will serve as a reference for webhook testing and validation, providing sample data that matches the structure of real GitHub webhook payloads.

## Relevant Files
Use these files to implement the feature:

- `adws/README.md` - Contains webhook documentation to understand the expected webhook payload structure and workflow keywords
- `adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py` - The webhook server implementation to understand what data format is expected

### New Files
- `test-webhook.md` - New file in project root containing mock webhook data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
Research the webhook implementation to understand the expected data format and structure of GitHub webhook payloads that the system processes.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
Create the test file with realistic mock data that matches the structure of actual GitHub webhook payloads, including issue events and comment events with ADW workflow keywords.

### Phase 3: Integration
Place the file in the project root for easy access and add documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Research webhook payload structure
- Read `adws/README.md` to understand the webhook workflow keywords (adw_plan, adw_build, adw_test, adw_plan_build, adw_plan_build_test)
- Read `adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py` to understand the expected webhook payload structure
- Note the key fields that the webhook processor uses

### Step 2: Create test-webhook.md with mock data
- Create `test-webhook.md` in the project root `/Users/bryson/Projects/tac/tac-5/`
- Include mock GitHub webhook payload data for:
  - An issue created event with `adw_plan_build` keyword
  - An issue comment event with `adw_test` keyword
- Format the data as readable markdown with JSON code blocks
- Add a header explaining this is test data for webhook validation
- Include all relevant fields: issue number, title, body, author, timestamps, etc.

### Step 3: Validate the file
- Read the created file to verify it contains all necessary mock data
- Ensure the format is clear and useful for testing
- Verify the file is in the correct location (project root)

### Step 4: Run validation commands
- Execute validation commands to ensure no regressions in the project
- Verify the test file is properly formatted and accessible

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
No unit tests required - this is a simple file creation task.

### Edge Cases
- File already exists (should overwrite)
- Invalid JSON in mock data (validate syntax)
- Missing required fields (ensure all key fields are present)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `test-webhook.md` file is created in the project root directory
- File contains realistic mock webhook payload data
- Mock data includes at least two examples: issue event and comment event
- Data structure matches the format expected by `trigger_webhook.py`
- File includes clear documentation of its purpose
- Mock data contains ADW workflow keywords (adw_plan_build, adw_test, etc.)
- File is readable and well-formatted with markdown

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

- `ls -la test-webhook.md` - Verify the file exists in project root
- `cat test-webhook.md` - Display file contents to validate format
- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate no regressions
- `cd app/client && bun tsc --noEmit` - Run frontend type check to validate no regressions
- `cd app/client && bun run build` - Run frontend build to validate no regressions

## Notes
- This is a temporary test file and can be deleted after webhook testing is complete
- The mock data should be realistic enough to test webhook processing logic
- Consider adding this file to `.gitignore` if it's not meant to be committed
- Future enhancement: Create a test script that actually sends this mock data to the webhook endpoint
- The file serves as documentation of expected webhook payload structure
